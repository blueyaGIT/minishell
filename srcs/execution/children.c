 * check_children - Waits for all child processes and returns the exit status.

 * This function performs the following steps:
 *
 * 
	- Calls kill_fds() to clean up file descriptors 
	associated with the command list.
 * 
 *  - Enters a loop that waits for any child process to finish using waitpid().
 * 
 *  - If the PID returned by waitpid() matches the shell's tracked PID,
	it stores the exit status.
 * 
 *  - Once all child processes have been reaped (when waitpid() returns
		-1 and errno is ECHILD), 
 *    it checks the stored status:
 * 		- If the child was terminated by a signal,
			returns 128 plus the signal number.
 *		- If the child exited normally, returns its exit code.
 *		- Otherwise, returns the raw exit status.
 *

	* @param shell: Pointer to the shell structure containing 
	command list and process IDs.

	* @return The final exit status after interpreting the exit 
	state(s) of the child processes.
